Malingee spirits come out at night - by Ben C

The theme of Fearful Symmetry got me thinking about monsters and things that go bump in the night, especially those that you can't see.  Australian Aboriginal folklore has it that Malingee are nasty spirits that can be heard knocking about in the night.  They will keep to themselves, but can turn aggressive if a human gets in their way.

In this scene, a hapless camper (the viewer) has stayed out on the lake fishing too close to sunset, just as the 100% humidity has finally turned into a rain shower.  Looking back at the lonely campfire on shore, a Malingee has arrived.  The camper never knew you could see Malingee, having only ever heard them clanking around in the distance, but the camper realises their reflections can be seen in the lake water, even as they fade on the shore.  The place is becoming infested, it's too dangerous to go back to shore now.  The camper has never seen them be so bold and huddle around a fire like this - what is it about this evening?  Is it that moon?

Better cover up and hope they don't notice us here out on the lake.  Hide and _don't_ rock the boat.  They won't come out over the water will they?

Years ago I visited Central Australia at a time when there was rain.  The beautiful colours left a strong impression on me, and I always admired Albert Namatjira's ability to capture these with his water colours.  For this piece I've taken inspiration from his Namatjira's ghostgums, landscapes (orange and purple mountains with the cooler colours retreating), and reflections in water.  Even the Malingee take on low-saturation hues that are reminiscent of the faded ochre rock colours.  Australian Aboriginal folklore is as rich and interesting as any culture in the world, and as superstitious as many as well.  

I hope you enjoy this piece, and I hope you remember the Malingee next time you're sitting around a campfire and you hear something in the distance...
