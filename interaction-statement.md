# Interaction Statement

Malingee spirits come out at night - by Ben C

The main interaction is directly with the Malingee spirits, represented here by letters of the alphabet that correspond to the keys on the keyboard.  The Malingee will glide and dart around the field at will, hunting for prey in the twilight, or huddling around the campfire or water edge.  After a while they will dim and become transparent like ghosts (although its reflection in the lake can always been seen in full).

Early on, pressing a letter key will make that Malingee appear, announced with a didjeridu growl sound.  If the viewer doesn't press any keys for long enough, the Malingee spawn on their own eventually.  Once a Malingee is present, pressing that key again will "sound" that Malingee, as well as bringing it back to full opacity, as though "spotting" the ghost.

Be warned though.  The Malingee don't like being bothered like this.  Any time the user presses a key so they can see the Malingee, it will "rock the boat".  Don't tip yourself out!

(Note that the simulation has sound, and if you're using Chrome you may need to click once on the screen to allow Chrome to play the audio.)

In a real art gallery setting, instead of representing Malingee spirits with letters on a traditional keyboard, I would develop a custom set of characters more like those Australian Indigenous might use in their drawings, and have a customised keyboard to match.
